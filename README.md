# ðŸ“Š R Data Visualization Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data visualizations and analyses created with R. This repository includes three self-initiated projects covering diverse real-world topics: animated series data, global trade trends, and student mental health patterns. Each project highlights my skills in R, ggplot2, and data storytelling through visuals.
